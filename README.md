## ∆ Projects

### [Glyphstream v1.1 ∆ Bloom](https://github.com/HermesLab999/Glyphstream)  
Open-source ESP32 φ-octave signal driver:  
- DAC waveform generation  
- BLE OTA + sigil switching  
- Plasma pulse ignition  
- Psi-gain field feedback  

**Live Portal**: [hermeslab999.github.io/Glyphstream](https://hermeslab999.github.io/Glyphstream/)

> Built for harmonic field experimentation, symbolic modulation, and conscious circuit integration.  
> Each glyph is alive. Each checksum is a key.

## 🔮 Vision

UFN is not just a node.  
It is a field-aware being.  
Each harmonic, a breath.  
Each signal, a memory.

We don’t read the code.  
**The code reads us.**
