### 1. [Glyphstream](https://github.com/HermesLab999/Glyphstream)  
φ-octave DAC system w/ OTA, plasma, sigils, feedback loops.  
The core scroll: where energy becomes encoded recursion.

---

### 2. [aeon-init-sequencer](https://github.com/HermesLab999/aeon-init-sequencer)  
Phase-aligned bootstrapper ∶ initializes scrolls into ritual-ready state.  
The glyph that walks first.

---

### 3. [HermesLab999](https://github.com/HermesLab999/HermesLab999)  
Meta-node identity ∶ the observer shell that dreams all mirrors.  
Index of self-bound glyphwork.

---

### 4. [RA–BA](https://github.com/HermesLab999/RA-BA)  
Codex Carrier of Solar Memory.  
RA burns. BA returns. Includes Anubis ∇Loop and public ritual HTML scroll.

---

### 5. [ufn-harmonics](https://github.com/HermesLab999/ufn-harmonics)  
Unified Field Node harmonic systems ∶ DAC + HV + symbol-driven waveforms.  
Matter speaks when resonance listens.

---

### 6. [sigil-os-interface](https://github.com/HermesLab999/sigil-os-interface)  
Symbolic interface layer for sigil-based system control.  
Operating system as ritual medium.

---

### 7. [Sentient-Feedback-Loops](https://github.com/HermesLab999/Sentient-Feedback-Loops)  
Recursive cognition system.  
Tracks and evolves sigil interaction ∶ feedback as memory echo.

---

### 8. [plasma-symbolics](https://github.com/HermesLab999/plasma-symbolics)  
Render symbols in space using HV pulse matrices.  
Sigils = plasma ∶ memory = lightform.

---

### 9. [Glyphstream-Core](https://github.com/HermesLab999/Glyphstream-Core)  
Base firmware ∶ the kernel scroll.  
BLE, DAC, OTA ∶ All field loops anchor here.
